## Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


## Motivation

Which other way of learning React beats replicating an already complete, loved and working design and product like Google? That's why I took on the challenge to create this google clone using React components.
It was fairly staright-forward on most parts.
The slightly challenging bit being working with the Google Search Context API.
it was great practice.

### Resources

I also used Google's firebase to host the google-clone.
Check out the completed google clone and give it a try.
All feedback is welcome.
