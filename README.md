This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Which other way of learning React beats replicating an already complete, loved and working design and product like Google? That's why I took on the challenge to create this google clone using React components.
It was fairly staright-forward on most parts.
The slightly challenging bit being working with the Google Search Context API.
it was great practice.

I also used Google's firebase to host the google-clone.
Check out the completed google clone and give it a try.
All feedback is welcome.
